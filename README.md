The intersection of quantitative finance and computer vision presents a novel frontier for exploring trading strategies. This study implements and extends the work of Cohen et al. (2020) in their paper ”Trading via Image Classification”, which proposes a paradigm shift in approaching financial time series analysis. The central question driving this research is: Can we construct a system that identifies and replicates human trading behavior through visual pattern recognition? 

Traditionally, algorithmic trading strategies have relied on processing time-series data as numerical lists, seeking to detect patterns such as trends, cycles, and correlations. Upon identifying such patterns, analysts typically construct algorithms to leverage these insights for predictive modeling. However, this approach may not fully capture the intuitive visual analysis performed by experienced human traders.

The focus of this implementation is on representing financial time-series data as images and examining the efficacy of using these visual representations alone for identifying trading opportunities typical of technical analysis. Additionally, we aim to bridge the gap between the proof-of-concept demonstrated in the original paper and a more practical, portfolio-based implementation. Our strategy utilizes the image-based classification method but extends it to create and manage a simulated portfolio.
